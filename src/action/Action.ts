/*
    This class should represent a single action in a card game, but generic enough
    to allow for just about anything (and serializeable/deserializeable to JSON).
    ie: Shuffling, Dealing, Scoring, Melding, etc...
    Should allow for nested actions
    ie: Round 1 Actions <Shuffle, Deal, Player 1 turn, Player 2 turn>, etc...
